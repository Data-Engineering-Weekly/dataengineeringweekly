  review: "Starting a new data job can be overwhelming. Figuring out a new company's infra, building relationships, and proving your worth all while jumping onto projects with barely any info? New hires need resources that skip the fancy talk and give them real-world help. 5X's recently concluded Day1 Summit offers valuable resources for new data hires to nail the first 90 days."
