*This is my story of how I became a Cofounder at [Avora](https://avora.com), an AI-powered business observability platform. Avora enables businesses to respond, quickly and with context, to unexpected changes in their metrics.*

### My Background
I've been a Data practitioner for about 12 years, working across industries such as eCommerce and FinTech. I've worked heavily in Analytics Engineering and Analytics, but broadly in Data.

  

During my time at Worldpay, I led a small team to build a system to predict our main metrics. This system was also able to explain why our metrics changed vs the past or forecast. It was a long and expensive process and involved me building a team to build, deploy and maintain it. While it was a success and well-used, it wasn't generic, it was very focused on a specific part of the payments system. I thought that a generic version of this system could be hugely valuable in analytics.

  

This team was the first Analytical team I built. I have since led and built multi-discipline data teams at Elevate Credit, Lyst and Ruby Labs.

### How I first came across Avora

Whilst at Elevate Credit, I attended Snowflake's first ever in person conference in London. One of the presentations I attended was by Avora about their then full-stack BI solution.

  

At the time I felt it could be of real benefit to Elevate Credit, as we had a very small data team with limited resources. The modern data stack did not exist yet, with even Fivetran being a scrappy startup at this point.

  

I managed to catch up with the presenter from Avora, and exchanged contacts to learn more later. This led to Avora coming into Elevate to pitch, with [Ricky Thomas](https://twitter.com/rickythomas888) my now cofounder, leading the pitch. The boardroom was hostile with people casting aspersions about whether Avora would work! Ricky managed to pitch well about the platform and team and we later signed with Avora.

  

As a customer of Avora, I was always impressed by the team and delivery. I was glad to have brought them in during my time at Elevate. Ricky and I stayed in touch and regularly discussed new features and trends in the industry.

### Advising

I started advising Avora, soon after this, on product features and UX. I was one of the first to see the Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) products pre-launch. For the last couple of years, I've advised Avora on further enhancements to these new products which are the basis of the NewCo I have joined.

Avora has needed a metrics layer, in order to provide AD and RCA on metric trends. This has been an internal one that is simple but powerful for customer needs; allowing for metric relationships and quick time to value. At the end of 2021, I had been guiding them towards is adopting the dbt metrics layer. I believed then, and more firmly now, that shared and standardised metrics layers will be widely adopted in the future. The potential for serving a wider customer base, and reducing onboarding friction, is a huge opportunity for Avora.

In parallel to advising, I also acted as a customer reference for Venture Capital funds. This has turned out to be very useful given I'm currently speaking to VCs to raise a seed round as a cofounder!

### Unexpected Opportunity
At the end of last year, it wasn't the right time to join Avora for myself or Avora. My personal circumstances changed at the start of March, and with good customer acquisition, the same was true for Avora! I have joined as cofounder to lead us towards:

-   integrations with metrics layers
-   technical partnerships in the Modern Data Stack
-   commercial partnerships
-   content and community engagement
-   product-led growth

I believe there is a missing tactical layer in how data serves the strategic apex:

1.  At the strategic layer, we now have tools enabling self-serve metrics and curated analytical research. This is difficult to automate without the advent of AGI! It's the consultative work that really fulfils humans in a data team, and empowers them to impact their org.
    
2.  At the tactical layer of the apex we have an opportunity to augment decisions that need to be made faster. These need human input, but with AI-powered context and monitoring. This is where [Avora](https://avora.com) fits in.
    
3.  At the operational layer decisions need to be made in their thousands and millions daily and possibly in real-time.

### Believe in what you do

Avora is a great opportunity for me to be a cofounder, with a level of safety in having an experienced cofounder in Ricky. More important than this, is that I really believe the time is right for our products to shine, and that they are sorely needed:

-   The Modern Data Stack is enabling a level of data maturity that wasn't possible even two years ago
-   Data consumers are hungry for richer actionable insights
-   The scale of complexity and change in data, mean data teams are struggling, with BI tools, to do the workload Avora automates
-   There is a real problem in the industry in shortage of engineers and data people to build internal teams
